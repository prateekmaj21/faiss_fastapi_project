Check Project_Details document for more information.

#### Important:

- Create a Python module `faiss_crud.py` to manage the FAISS index and perform CRUD operations.
- main.py for the Main Application.
- pip install -r `requirements.txt`


#### Running Uvicorn Directly Using Python:
Ensure you are in the project directory:

cd (PATH)faiss_fastapi_project

python -m uvicorn main:app --reload


#### Setup Postman for CRUD Operations:

Postman is a software application that allows developers to test, document, and share APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).
